            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <l>WHen <hi>David</hi> in <hi>Jeruſalem</hi>
               </l>
               <l>as Royal King did rule and reign,</l>
               <l>Behold what happened unto him,</l>
               <l>that afterwards procur'd his pain:</l>
               <l>On the top of all his Princely Palace,</l>
               <l>a gallant proſpect there had he,</l>
               <l>From whence he might, when't pleas'd his Grace,</l>
               <l>many a gallant garden ſee:</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>It chanced ſo upon a day,</l>
               <l>the King went forth to take the air,</l>
               <l>All in the pleaſant month of <hi>May,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>whereas he ſpy'd a Lady fair,</l>
               <l>Her beauty was more excellent,</l>
               <l>and brighter than the Morning-ſun,</l>
               <l>By which the King incontinent,</l>
               <l>was to her favour quickly won.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>She ſtood within a pleaſant bower,</l>
               <l>all naked for to waſh her there,</l>
               <l>Her body like a lilly flower,</l>
               <l>was covered with her golden hair:</l>
               <l>The King was wounded with her love,</l>
               <l>and what ſhe was he did require,</l>
               <l>He could not his affections move,</l>
               <l>he had in her ſuch great deſire:</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>She is <hi>Uriah</hi>'s Wife, quoth they,</l>
               <l>a Captain of your Princely Train,</l>
               <l>That in your wars is now away,</l>
               <l>and ſhe doth all alone remain.</l>
               <l>Then ſaid the King, Bring her to me,</l>
               <l>for with her love my heart is ſlain,</l>
               <l>The Princeſs of Beauty ſure is ſhe,</l>
               <l>for whom I do great grief ſuſtain.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>The Servants they do ſoon prepare,</l>
               <l>to do the Meſſage of the King;</l>
               <l>And <hi>Berſheba,</hi> the Lady fair,</l>
               <l>unto the Court did quickly bring.</l>
               <l>The King rejoyced at her ſight,</l>
               <l>and won her love, and lay'd her by,</l>
               <l>They ſpent the night in fond delight,</l>
               <l>until the ſun was riſen high;</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>The King his leave moſt kindly took,</l>
               <l>till that three months were gone and paſt,</l>
               <l>And then again he did return,</l>
               <l>with wondrous ſpeed and haſte.</l>
               <l>And then the Lady <hi>Berſheba,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>ſhe found her former health exil'd,</l>
               <l>By certain tokens that ſhe ſaw,</l>
               <l>the King had gotten her with child:</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Then to the King ſhe made her moan,</l>
               <l>and told him how the caſe did ſtand;</l>
               <l>The King ſent for her Husband home,</l>
               <l>to cloak the matter out of hand.</l>
               <l>When from the Camp <hi>Uriah</hi> came,</l>
               <l>the King receiv'd him courteouſly,</l>
               <l>Demanding how all things did frame,</l>
               <l>concerning of the Enemy:</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>
                  <hi>Uriah</hi> ſhew'd his Highneſs all</l>
               <l>the accidents of warlike ſtrife;</l>
               <l>Then ſaid the King, This night you ſhall</l>
               <l>keep company with your own Wife.</l>
               <l>The Ark of God, <hi>Uriah</hi> ſaid,</l>
               <l>with <hi>Judah</hi>'s Hoaſt, and <hi>Iſrael,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>Keep in the field, and not a Man</l>
               <l>within the houſe where they do dwell;</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Then ſhould I take my eaſe, (quoth he)</l>
               <l>in bed of down with my fair Wife;</l>
               <l>O King, he ſaid, that may not be,</l>
               <l>ſo long as I enjoy my life.</l>
               <l>Then did the King a letter frame,</l>
               <l>to <hi>Joab,</hi> General of the Hoſt,</l>
               <l>And by <hi>Uriah</hi> ſent the ſame,</l>
               <l>but certainly his life it coſt.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>And when the King for certain knew</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Uriah</hi> thus had murdered been,</l>
               <l>Fair <hi>Berſheba</hi> to the Court he drew,</l>
               <l>and made of her his Royal Queen:</l>
               <l>Then God that ſaw this wicked deed,</l>
               <l>was angry at King <hi>David</hi>'s ſin,</l>
               <l>The Prophet <hi>Nathan</hi> then with ſpeed,</l>
               <l>came thus complaining unto him,</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>O <hi>David,</hi> ponder what I ſay,</l>
               <l>a great abuſe I ſhall the tell,</l>
               <l>For thou that rul'ſt in equity,</l>
               <l>ſhould ſee the People govern'd well;</l>
               <l>Two Men within the City dwell,</l>
               <l>the one is rich the other poor,</l>
               <l>The rich in cattel doth excel.</l>
               <l>the other nothing hath in ſtore,</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Saving one little silly ſheep,</l>
               <l>which young he did with mony buy,</l>
               <l>With his own bread he did it feed,</l>
               <l>amongſt his Children tenderly:</l>
               <l>The rich Man had a Stranger came</l>
               <l>unto his houſe that lov'd him dear,</l>
               <l>The poor Man's ſheep therefore he took</l>
               <l>and thereof made his Friend good chear,</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Becauſe that he his own would ſpare,</l>
               <l>he us'd the Man moſt cruelly.</l>
               <l>Then by the Lord, the King did ſwear,</l>
               <l>the rich Man for that fault ſhould dye.</l>
               <l>Thou art the Man, the Prophet ſaid,</l>
               <l>the Princely Crown God gave to thee,</l>
               <l>The Lord's Wife, thou thy own haſt made,</l>
               <l>and many more of fair beauty:</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Why haſt thou ſo defil'd thy life,</l>
               <l>and ſlain <hi>Uriah</hi> with the ſword,</l>
               <l>And taken home his wedded Wife,</l>
               <l>regarding not God's holy Word?</l>
               <l>Therefore behold, thus ſaith the Lord,</l>
               <l>Great wars upon thy houſe ſhall be;</l>
               <l>Becauſe thou haſt my Laws abhor'd,</l>
               <l>much ill be ſure i'll caſt on thee:</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>I'll take thy Wives before thy face,</l>
               <l>and give them to their Neighbours uſe,</l>
               <l>And thou thereby ſhall reap diſgrace,</l>
               <l>for Man ſhall laugh at thy abuſe.</l>
               <l>Then <hi>David</hi> cryed out piteouſly,</l>
               <l>Sore have I ſinned againſt the Lord,</l>
               <l>In mercy therefore look on me,</l>
               <l>let not my prayers be abhor'd.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>But as the Prophet told to him,</l>
               <l>ſo did it after chance indeed,</l>
               <l>For God did greatly plaugue his ſin,</l>
